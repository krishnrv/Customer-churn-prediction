# Customer-churn-prediction

The purpose of this project is to explore a customer database from Kaggle in order to draw actionable insights about customer churn.

The database being used is drawn from a Telco company. For the purposes of our analysis, we will be seeking to understand what attributes drive churn (tenure,type of customer service,) and then seeking to build models that predict which customers will provide recurring revenue over a lifetime. This will inform how to market to customers going forward.

We folowe the following processes :

Data Preprocessing:

Data cleaning:

Data Transformation

Normalization

Smote(Oversampling)

    Logistic Regression

    Linear Discriminant classifier

    K Nearest Neighbour

    Naive Baye's Classifier


    SVM

    Random Forest Classifier

    AdaBoost Classifier
